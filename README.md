**Tired of clicking or typing for logging into VTOP?**
This extension does just that. Logs into VTOP all the way through no matter WHAT(atleast in most cases).

# Usage
Go to manage extensions -> load unpacked and select VTOP_auto folder.\
Click the extension icon and enter your credentials (credentials are synced with your chrome profile using chrome api).\
After submitting the form simply open VTOP.

# Issues
No "404 page not found" handling, if captcha fails entire login process stops unless page is reloaded manually.
